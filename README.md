# How to Use the Bot
To ensure smooth operation of the bot, please follow these steps when you first run it:

1-Position the Window: 
After starting the bot, adjust the position of its window on your screen. This is important to prevent any issues related to window placement or overlap with other applications.

2-Configuration Check:
Ensure that all necessary configurations are set correctly. This might include setting up environment variables, configuring settings, or ensuring that the bot has the necessary permissions.

3-Start the Bot: 
Once the window is correctly positioned and all configurations are verified, you can start the bot's main functionality.

4-Monitor the Bot:
Keep an eye on the bot's operation during its initial run. This will help you catch any unexpected behavior early on.
