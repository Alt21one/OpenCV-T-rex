# How to Use the Bot
To ensure smooth operation of the bot, please follow these steps when you first run it:

1-Window Title:
Make sure to change the window title for the bot to work properly. If you are using Chrome or Edge, you will need to change the title, and it only works for the T-rex night mode.

2-Position the Window: 
After starting the bot, adjust the position of its window on your screen. This is important to prevent any issues related to window placement or overlap with other applications.

3-Configuration Check:
Ensure that all necessary configurations are set correctly. This might include setting up environment variables, configuring settings, or ensuring that the bot has the necessary permissions.

4-Start the Bot: 
Once the window is correctly positioned and all configurations are verified, you can start the bot's main functionality.

5-Monitor the Bot:
Keep an eye on the bot's operation during its initial run. This will help you catch any unexpected behavior early on.
